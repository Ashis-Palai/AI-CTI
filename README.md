# ThreatVerse: AI-Powered Cyber Threat Intelligence Framework

**ThreatVerse** is a hands-on, end-to-end AI-powered Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) platform designed to demonstrate the full lifecycle of intelligent threat analysis â€” from data gathering and processing to decision-making using AI agents and model deployment.

This project aims to integrate modern AI/ML capabilities with security intelligence workflows including:

- AI model training, fine-tuning, and deployment (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with vector databases
- Graph-based knowledge modeling using Neo4j
- Multi-agent systems using CrewAI, Autogen, LangGraph
- Integration with Hugging Face, OpenAI, and open-source LLMs (LLaMA, Mistral, DeepSeek)
- Backend APIs, MLOps, monitoring, and GUI integrations (FastAPI, ComfyUI)
- Production-ready deployment on cloud environments (Colab, AWS, GCP)
