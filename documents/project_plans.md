# ✅ Step 2: Project Idea — "ThreatVerse": AI-Powered Cyber Threat Intelligence Ecosystem

## 🎯 Goal:
Build an end-to-end platform for cyber threat profiling, TTP extraction, graph-based threat correlation, and interactive decision-making using AI agents, all backed by modular and scalable components.

---

## 🧪 Project Architecture

### 📥 A. Input Module
- User uploads IOCs, CVEs, malware hashes, threat reports (PDF/HTML links)  
- Use FastAPI-based frontend with file upload or URL input  

---

### 🤖 B. AI-Powered Preprocessing Agent
- Use Autogen or CrewAI agent  
- Extract structured data (TTPs, threat actors, indicators) using:  
  - LLM-based extractors (OpenAI / Mistral fine-tuned on CTI schema)  
  - LangChain + Unstructured + PyMuPDF for chunking & parsing PDFs  

---

### 🔎 C. RAG-based Intelligence Layer
- Use a fine-tuned local model via Huggingface (e.g., Mistral or DeepSeek)  
- Tools:
  - LangChain / LangGraph  
  - Vector DBs: pgvector or Milvus (for local dev), Pinecone (for prod)  
  - Multi-tenant pipelines for secure multi-user support  
  - Embeddings via Huggingface or OpenAI models  
- Includes:
  - Prompt engineering  
  - Memory for agent continuity  
  - Ranking strategies for document relevance  

---

### 🌐 D. Graph Intelligence
- Use Neo4j to create:  
  - Threat Actor – TTP – Malware – CVE graph  
- Queryable via natural language using agent (LangChain or CrewAI integration)  
- Connect graph to the RAG pipeline  

---

### 🤖 E. Decision Support Agents
- Multi-agent workflow using LangGraph or CrewAI  
- Agents:
  - Enricher Agent (pulls from external OSINT sources via APIs)  
  - Correlator Agent (matches TTPs, actors, CVEs)  
  - Analyst Agent (generates summary, recommends actions)  
  - UI Assistant Agent (interfaces with the GUI)  

---

### 🚀 F. Model Training & Fine-Tuning
- Train/fine-tune a small model (e.g., TinyLlama or Falcon) on structured CTI data  
- Tools:
  - PyTorch or TensorFlow  
  - Export to GGUF  
  - Deploy via llama.cpp or text-generation-inference  

---

### 📦 G. Deployment & Serving
- All models and agents deployed as microservices  
- Tools:
  - Docker, Kubernetes (orchestration)  
  - RESTful APIs (FastAPI)  
  - Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana  
- Cloud: AWS/GCP  

---

### 🎛️ H. GUI/UX Layer
- Use ComfyUI or Streamlit for:
  - Threat summary visualization  
  - Knowledge graph visualization  
  - Agent conversation/chat
